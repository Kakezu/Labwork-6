# FitFlow Studio - A gym application made with Ionic Framework

This is a application for members of a fictional gym called FitFlow Studio. It was made to test the capabilities of Ionic Framework for a school project as a team of 4 persons. As I am writing this ReadMe (5/2024), the application is not working past the Login/Registration due to conflicts in Firebase authentication but maybe someday will be fixed.
